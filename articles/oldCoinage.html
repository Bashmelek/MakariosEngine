            <span>
                I began thinking more deeply about coinage in medieval times
                when I read the fanciful article <a href="https://critical-hits.com/blog/2017/02/22/the-wizards-and-the-sheep/">The Wizards and the Sheep</a>.
                Fun read, yet I was struck by, for all of its thought and well developed economics of production, it glossed over currency and assumed a DnD system of 10 copper > 1 silver, 10 silver > 1 gold!
                Probably because it is a DnD blog.

                This page is a collection of things I have found in my research on old coinage and money systems, to help gain a better understanding of how these things worked in day to day life
                in the past.  It is for anyone who is interested in history or creating a fantasy world of their own. Focus will be on medieval Europe, but certainly not restricted to that time nor place.
